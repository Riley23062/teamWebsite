<h1>GREETINGS HUMANS!</h1>
<p>I am Dylan (or NeosChampionX, depending on where you may know me from), your average, everyday, friendly person and a member of Worse Company!</p>
<p>I like playing League of Legends, a Yu-Gi-Oh player, proficient in Javascript, and a fan of the Touhou Project. </p>
<p>I do like keeping to myself sometimes, but I am good at talking to people. </p>
